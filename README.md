This is a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants to interact with the [Qwen Code](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/qwen/). It enables the AI to leverage the power of Qwen's massive token window for large analysis, especially with large files and codebases using the `@` syntax for direction.

- Ask Qwen natural questions, through claude or Brainstorm new ideas in a party of 3!

## TLDR: [![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=fff)](#) + [![Qwen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qwen-886FBF?logo=qwen&logoColor=fff)](#)


**Goal**: Use Qwen's powerful analysis capabilities directly in Claude Code to save tokens and analyze large files.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16.0.0 or higher)
2. **[Qwen Code](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/qwen/)** installed and configured (command-line tool: `qwen`)


### One-Line Setup

```bash
claude mcp add qwen-code -- npx -y qwen-mcp-tool
```

### Verify Installation

Type `/mcp` inside Claude Code to verify the Qwen Code MCP is active.

---

### Alternative: Import from Claude Desktop

If you already have it configured in Claude Desktop:

1. Add to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
"qwen-code": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "qwen-mcp-tool"]
}
```

2. Import to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

## Configuration

Register the MCP server with your MCP client:

### For NPX Usage (Recommended)

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qwen-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "qwen-mcp-tool"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Global Installation

If you installed globally, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qwen-code": {
      "command": "qwen-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration File Locations:**

- **Claude Desktop**:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

After updating the configuration, restart your terminal session.

## Example Workflow

- **Natural language**: "use qwen to explain index.html", "understand the massive project using qwen", "ask qwen to search for latest news"
- **Claude Code**: Type `/qwen-code` and commands will populate in Claude Code's interface.

## Usage Examples

### With File References (using @ syntax)

- `ask qwen to analyze @src/main.js and explain what it does`
- `use qwen to summarize @. the current directory`
- `analyze @package.json and tell me about dependencies`

### General Questions (without files)

- `ask qwen to search for the latest tech news`
- `use qwen to explain div centering`
- `ask qwen about best practices for React development related to @file_im_confused_about`

### Using Qwen Code's Sandbox Mode (-s)

The sandbox mode allows you to safely test code changes, run scripts, or execute potentially risky operations in an isolated environment.

- `use qwen sandbox to create and run a Python script that processes data`
- `ask qwen to safely test @script.py and explain what it does`
- `use qwen sandbox to install numpy and create a data visualization`
- `test this code safely: Create a script that makes HTTP requests to an API`

### Tools (for the AI)

These tools are designed to be used by the AI assistant.

- **`ask-qwen`**: Asks Qwen for its perspective. Can be used for general questions or complex analysis of files.
  - **`prompt`** (required): The analysis request. Use the `@` syntax to include file or directory references (e.g., `@src/main.js explain this code`) or ask general questions (e.g., `Please use a web search to find the latest news stories`).
  - **`model`** (optional): The Qwen model to use. Defaults to `qwen-plus`.
  - **`sandbox`** (optional): Set to `true` to run in sandbox mode for safe code execution.
- **`sandbox-test`**: Safely executes code or commands in Qwen's sandbox environment. Always runs in sandbox mode.
  - **`prompt`** (required): Code testing request (e.g., `Create and run a Python script that...` or `@script.py Run this safely`).
  - **`model`** (optional): The Qwen model to use.
- **`Ping`**: A simple test tool that echoes back a message.
- **`Help`**: Shows the Qwen Code help text.

### Slash Commands (for the User)

You can use these commands directly in Claude Code's interface (compatibility with other clients has not been tested).

- **/analyze**: Analyzes files or directories using Qwen, or asks general questions.
  - **`prompt`** (required): The analysis prompt. Use `@` syntax to include files (e.g., `/analyze prompt:@src/ summarize this directory`) or ask general questions (e.g., `/analyze prompt:Please use a web search to find the latest news stories`).
- **/sandbox**: Safely tests code or scripts in Qwen's sandbox environment.
  - **`prompt`** (required): Code testing request (e.g., `/sandbox prompt:Create and run a Python script that processes CSV data` or `/sandbox prompt:@script.py Test this script safely`).
- **/help**: Displays the Qwen Code help information.
- **/ping**: Tests the connection to the server.
  - **`message`** (optional): A message to echo back.
