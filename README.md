## Supercharged Programming with Qwen Code

Qwen Code is specifically designed for programming tasks, offering advanced capabilities in code generation, review, refactoring, and explanation. With this MCP tool, you can harness Qwen Code's powerful programming features directly from Claude.

This is a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants to interact with the [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git). It enables the AI to leverage the power of Qwen's massive token window for large analysis, especially with large files and codebases using the `@` syntax for direction.

- Ask Qwen natural questions, through claude or Brainstorm new ideas in a party of 3!

## TLDR: [![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=fff)](#) + [![Qwen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qwen-886FBF?logo=qwen&logoColor=fff)](#)


**Goal**: Use Qwen's powerful analysis capabilities directly in Claude Code to save tokens and analyze large files.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16.0.0 or higher)
2. **[Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git)** installed and configured (command-line tool: `qwen`)

### Qwen Code Programming Capabilities

Qwen Code offers advanced programming capabilities:

- **Code Generation**: Create code from natural language descriptions
- **Code Review**: Analyze code for quality, performance, and security issues
- **Code Refactoring**: Improve code structure and readability
- **Code Explanation**: Understand complex code with detailed explanations


### One-Line Setup

```bash
claude mcp add qwen-code -- npx -y qwen-mcp-tool
```

### Verify Installation

Type `/mcp` inside Claude Code to verify the Qwen Code MCP is active.

---

### Alternative: Import from Claude Desktop

If you already have it configured in Claude Desktop:

1. Add to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
"qwen-code": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "qwen-mcp-tool"]
}
```

2. Import to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

## Configuration

Register the MCP server with your MCP client:

### For NPX Usage (Recommended)

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qwen-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "qwen-mcp-tool"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Global Installation

If you installed globally, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qwen-code": {
      "command": "qwen-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration File Locations:**

- **Claude Desktop**:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

After updating the configuration, restart your terminal session.

## Example Workflow

- **Natural language**: "use qwen to explain index.html", "understand the massive project using qwen", "ask qwen to search for latest news"
- **Claude Code**: Type `/qwen-code` and commands will populate in Claude Code's interface.

## Usage Examples

### With File References (using @ syntax)

- `ask qwen to analyze @src/main.js and explain what it does`
- `use qwen to summarize @. the current directory`
- `analyze @package.json and tell me about dependencies`

### General Questions (without files)

- `ask qwen to search for the latest tech news`
- `use qwen to explain div centering`
- `ask qwen about best practices for React development related to @file_im_confused_about`

### Using Qwen Code's Sandbox Mode (-s)

The sandbox mode allows you to safely test code changes, run scripts, or execute potentially risky operations in an isolated environment.

- `use qwen sandbox to create and run a Python script that processes data`
- `ask qwen to safely test @script.py and explain what it does`
- `use qwen sandbox to install numpy and create a data visualization`
- `test this code safely: Create a script that makes HTTP requests to an API`

### Tools (for the AI)

These tools are designed to be used by the AI assistant, with enhanced programming capabilities.

- **`ask-qwen`**: Asks Qwen for its perspective. Can be used for general questions or complex analysis of files.
  - **`prompt`** (required): The analysis request. Use the `@` syntax to include file or directory references (e.g., `@src/main.js explain this code`) or ask general questions (e.g., `Please use a web search to find the latest news stories`).
  - **`model`** (optional): The Qwen model to use. Defaults to `qwen-plus`.
