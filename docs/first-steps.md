# First Steps

Once installed, here's how to get started with Qwen MCP Tool.

## Test Connection

```

```

## Basic File Analysis

Analyze a single file:
```

```

## Natural Language Usage

Just ask naturally:
- "Use qwen to explain this codebase"
- "Ask qwen to analyze the architecture"
- "Have qwen review this function"

## Sandbox Testing

Test code safely:
```
/qwen-code:sandbox create a Python script that generates fibonacci numbers
```
